# Design Patterns in Java 🚀

This repository contains my implementations of common **Design Patterns** in Java.  
It serves as both a **learning reference** and a **ready-to-use guide** for interviews and projects.

---

## 📌 Why this repo?
- To practice and understand **object-oriented design principles**.
- To implement each pattern with **clean, well-documented code**.
- To create a **reference library** that I can use in system design/LLD interviews.
